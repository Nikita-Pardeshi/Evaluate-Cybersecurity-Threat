                <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                  In 2018, the Department of Defense faced a threat to its military advantage 
                  by determined adversaries and their intent to steal plans, documentation, 
                  designs, and intellectual property for key weapon systems. In response to this
                  threat, the Department established the Protecting Critical Technology Task 
                  Force (PCTTF) in 2018, which, across four lines of effort, aimed to improve 
                  the cybersecurity of the Defense Industrial Base, secure the Department of 
                  Defense research and development enterprise, stop technology leakage through 
                  export and foreign ownership, and impose costs on adversary intelligence
                  campaigns. 

              </p>

              <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                <b>The Department relies on its prime contractors to ensure the 
                  sanctity and operational security of critical information 
                  integrated in its programsâ€”close coordination, cyber-conscious 
                  program management, and the establishment of appropriate 
                  incentives are critical. </b> Hence, it becomes extremely important to 
                identify SMBs (small-to-medium business) that might pose a threat to 
                the federal department and it's research and acitivities.

                <h4>Number of contracts funded by Subagency</h4>
                <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                  From the figure alongside, it can be seen that over 70% of the contracts are funded by 
                  The DARPA and over 25% of the contracts funded by the Department of Air Force. It becomes
                  extremely important to accurately evaluate the threats posed by the subcontractors since all
                  the contracts heavily involve state secrets, plans, politicies, systems in place and access to them.

                  contracts are Goods Manufacturers and For-profit firms/ companies.
                  A research published by Deloitte- Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation (MAPI)
                  found that most of the cyber threats experienced by manufacturers were coming from internal employees through phishing, direct abuse of IT systems, 
                  errors and omissions and use of mobile devices.

                <ul>
                  <li>

              <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">It can be seen that the different projects undertaken by the NSA and the contractors are related to Hypersonic Air Breat which is one of the
              most recent developments in Hypersonic missiles and still in development stages in many countries. A cyberattack on such a crucial and sensitive weapon, in the 
              wrong hands, can lead to a nuclear war.

              <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                  One very interesting observation is that the only parent company- ORBITAL ATK, INC. (ALLIANT TECHSYSTEMS OPERATIONS LLC) is working on the AMS:AAWS project 
                  which makes this a unique project out of the all along with AMS:HYPERSONICS. Interestingly, the same subawardee ALLIANT TECHSYSTEMS OPERATIONS LLC is the
                  company/ subsidary/ branch of the ORBITAL ATK, INC. with the maximum number of awards granted which makes this company and parent company
                  one the most important subcontractors.

                extremely important because in the U.S. cybersecurity laws exist at both the federal and state levels and vary by commercial sectors.
